<h3>What is Go?</h3>
<p>"Go is the simplest of all games. We try to surround territory and to avoid being surrounded. The distilled essence of "game" in one simple concept. Go is the most complex of all games. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1â€¢10<sup>170</sup>, which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, estimated to be of the order of 1080."  <sup>[1]</sup></p>
<h3>Why should you play?</h3>
<p>Well, it's fun. And we have cookies. Chocolate cookies.</p>
<h3><b>What do you guys do?</b></h3>
<p>We play Go, eat cookies, and occasionally somehow end up playing poker.</p>
<h3>How do I become a member?</h3>
<p>Show up at least once. Email me at s-huangemm@bsd405.org and I'll add your picture in the members section.</p>
<h3><b>Where can you find us?</b></h3>
<p>We meet every Monday in room 2704 at 3:30 (officially). But it really starts whenever people start showing up, which typically happens at around 3:10.</p>
